# SOLUTION 1

# CSS GRID vs CSS FLEXBOX

## CSS Grid Layout:

- Grid layout is two-dimensional, allowing you to create rows and columns.
- You can define a grid container and specify the number of rows and columns, as well as their sizes and positions.
- Grid items are placed within this grid, and their placement can be controlled explicitly by specifying the row and column they occupy.
- It's great for creating complex layouts, such as those with header, footer, and sidebars, where elements are aligned both vertically and horizontally.


## CSS Flexbox Layout:

- Flexbox is one-dimensional and focuses on distributing space along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
- You create a flex container and place flex items inside it. The items are laid out along the main axis and can be reordered based on their source order.
- Flexbox is ideal for building components within a layout, such as navigation menus or lists, where you want items to expand or shrink to fill available space along a single axis.

**Note -** CSS Grid is best for creating two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns, while Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, optimizing the distribution of space along a single axis. These two layout models can be used together to create more complex and responsive designs.

## Choice between both

**Choose `CSS Grid` when :**

- You need to create complex layouts with both rows and columns.
- You want precise control over the placement of items within the grid.
- Your layout requires alignment along both the horizontal and vertical axes.
- You're designing the overall structure of a page, including headers, footers, and content areas.

**Choose `CSS Flexbox` when :**

- You're working with one-dimensional layouts, like navigation menus, lists, or card-based designs.
- You want items to automatically adjust their size to fill available space along a single axis.
- You prioritize the order of items based on their source order (in HTML).
- You need flexibility in arranging items along either the horizontal or vertical axis, but not both.


**Note -**In many cases, you may even use both CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox within the same project. For example, you could use Grid to structure the overall page layout and Flexbox to fine-tune the alignment and distribution of items within specific sections. It's about selecting the right tool for the specific layout or component you're designing.
